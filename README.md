# LLM Book Finder

LLM Book Finder is a simple autonomous agent designed to help users find the top books in any genre. The application leverages FastAPI to create a RESTful API and utilizes the Google Books API to fetch book data. This project serves as a practical example of using machine learning models and RESTful services to create an interactive, automated book recommendation system.
